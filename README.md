Experimental web application to download videos via a websocket on the target PC.

The application is now fully operational using the Node.js web socket server.

To be able to run the web socket server: 
- Node.js must be installed on your system
- yt-dlp and ffmepg utilities must be installed and in your PATH
- on Linux/MacOS only, insure xterm terminal is installed
- add the "websocket" directory on your drive

To run: 
- start with the ydownloader.sh (on Linux/MacOS)
   or
- start with ydownloader.vbs (on Windows)

The server will (should:) automatically open the web application using your default browser.
